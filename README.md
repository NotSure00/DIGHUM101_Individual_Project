# DIGHUM101_Individual_Project
Abstract: In this project I will be leveraging a dataset of loan applications from three major lenders (real names redacted) in order to best understand the differences in their underwriting considerations when it comes to job type and employment sectors in order to understand why applicants are being denied and then see how we can benefit applicants through different online tools in order to improve their approval rates as well as determine which lender has the highest approval rates in order consider which lender is the most socially equitable. Furthermore, I will consider if there are any potential government sponsored online tools or policies that would be appropriate to increase the working classâ€™s approval rates.
